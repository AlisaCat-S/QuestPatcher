# QuestPatcher

QuestPatcher is a WIP GUI based mod installer for GorillaTag on the Oculus Quest.
It should support Windows, Mac and Linux.


It uses Sc2ad's [QuestLoader](https://github.com/sc2ad/QuestLoader/) for loading mods and is based mostly on RedBrumbler's [CLI Tool](https://github.com/RedBrumbler/QuestAppPatcher).

Currently it isn't released, as several more things still need to be added:
## TODO
- Support for installing mods using a manifest format.
- Make it game-agnostic.
- Add support for uninstalling mods.
- Improve GUI perhaps
- Come up with a better name
