# QuestPatcher

QuestPatcher is a WIP GUI based mod installer for any il2cpp unity app on the Oculus Quest.
It was originally created for modding GorillaTag.

It should support Windows, Mac and Linux.

It uses Sc2ad's [QuestLoader](https://github.com/sc2ad/QuestLoader/) for loading mods and is based mostly on RedBrumbler's [CLI Tool](https://github.com/RedBrumbler/QuestAppPatcher).

Currently it isn't released, as several more things still need to be added:

See `resources/qmod.schema.json` for the `mod.json` that QMODs must contain, alongside their mod files.

**NOTE:** To mod other games, edit `appId.txt` with the package ID of the app on your Quest that you want to mod.

## TODO
- Improve GUI perhaps
